# Standard Structure of a 10-Page Book Proposal

## Cover Page (1 page)
- **Title of the book**
- **Author's name, contact information, and date**
- **A brief tagline or subtitle summarizing the book's theme**

## Overview (1-2 pages)
- A concise summary of the book's content, themes, and purpose.
- Highlight what makes the book unique and its significance in the market.
- Include a compelling "hook" to engage the reader.

This book is a thoughtfully curated guide for your attention. Blockchain is an intellectually demanding subject, and its open technical details draw experts from various domains who offer their best insights. However, this creates a challenge for the average reader, who may get lost in the minutiae of every tiny detail. We believe there are more essential concepts for the general public to understand, so we aim to keep you out of those rabbit holes.

Let’s illustrate this with a couple of examples.

**Consensus mechanisms** tend to attract a lot of attention. However, for most readers, understanding *finality* or the *chain-based fork choice rule* may not be as crucial as grasping the security margin created by the staked assets.

Another example involves **Ethereum**. Many people mistakenly think learning Ethereum means immediately learning Solidity. But this is the wrong approach. It’s not like learning Python versus JavaScript, where different languages operate on the same computer and computational model. In Ethereum, you're engaging with an entirely different kind of computer and computation model, likely one you haven’t encountered before. Therefore, before learning the language, it’s more important to understand *who* you are interacting with: the new, decentralized computer.

We won’t provide hands-on instructions here. These can quickly become outdated and require significant effort to deliver smoothly. Instead, we’ll leave those to the experts. However, we will describe hands-on experiences you might encounter. For example:

- **Syncing a full node** for a fully decentralized experience: It takes more than 24 hours to sync a mainnet full node.
- **Syncing a testnet full node** and claiming testnet tokens: This can be more challenging than you might expect, as detailed [here](https://yahsin.me/2024/12/13/testnet/).
- **Creating a wallet** and recording a mnemonic key: Many existing books already cover this process.

Writing about a fast-evolving system like Ethereum is inherently difficult. Everything feels outdated almost as soon as it’s documented. When the status quo always has room for improvement, why write instead of build? Yet, as Ethereum reaches its 9th year, more effective communication could be a valuable contribution to the ecosystem.
