# The physics of data

An apple falls, and a boat floats. Knowing physics allows engineers to design buildings and bridges. The same applies to data. The design of a computer system is limited by how we can manipulate data in a various way.

But data is invisible. You don't see how your email got sent through the air (wifi), land (fibers), and sea(submarine cables). Abstract reasonings are required to understand data.

This chapter is served as a reference.

## Data can be represented as bits, bytes, and hex



## Cryptography

- Hash function
- Digital Signatures
- Computations: Programmable Cryptography. ZK, MPC, IO
