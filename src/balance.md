# Reasoning with Balances


How are money stored on a blockchain?

People use physical money in daily life. Even with the prolification of digital payments. People might still reason a financial transfer as I give a physical thingy to other person.

I was once asked that if there are some atoms or substances stored in the blockchain. But that is not the case.
Everythings stored on the blockchain or any computer system is just data. And even experts could forget about this fact. because in their mind they still reason the transfer with physical stuff.
